            "content:encoded": "<p>I don‚Äôt know where the inspiration for this came from, maybe it was seeing my biscuit tin disappear upstairs most evenings with one of the kids looking decidedly shifty with a biscuit tin shaped bulge under their jumpers.</p>
  <p>Either way as a software developer, I‚Äôve always been curious about the link between software and hardware with hardware always being something of a mystery to me.</p>
  <p>That all changed when I bought a Raspberry Pi, a well known low cost computer running an ARM chip that offers a simple IO (Input/Output) interface allowing you to plug in custom hardware that could be controlled by simple scripts.</p>
  <p>It was probably a slightly drunken conversation with a fellow developer at Wagama‚Äôs then, that planted the seed. What if you could take a random household item and make it ‚Äúsmart‚Äù by connecting it to the internet? The ‚Äúsmart‚Äù biscuit tin was born, as let‚Äôs face it, everyone loves biscuits right?</p>
  <p><strong>So‚Ä¶.after a tonne of Googling, here‚Äôs what I found:</strong></p>
  <p>Raspberry Pi, connected to something called a HX711 Load Cell (the thing that measures weight), some wires, some jack plugs and that was the hardware sorted.</p>
  <p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3941\" src=\"https://www.fl1digital.com/stuff/uploads/Biscuit-tin-2.jpg\" alt=\"Biscuit tin\" width=\"601\" height=\"802\" srcset=\"https://fl1digital.com/stuff/uploads/Biscuit-tin-2.jpg 601w, https://fl1digital.com/stuff/uploads/Biscuit-tin-2-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" /></p>
  <p><strong>How about the software?</strong></p>
  <p>To measure the biscuit weight, I needed to write a small controller script to run on the Rasberry Pi. The script would take a measure of the Load cell every couple of seconds.</p>
  <p>What I quickly realised is that even when static, the weight reads varied, so I had to build in a tolerance of +/- <em>n</em> grams. Normally at FL1 we used PHP, so time to quickly learn Python!</p>
  <p>Next, was picking up notable changes. I bought a Sainsburys variety pack of biscuits, just so I could weigh them, and I can tell you now, the average biscuit weight is 9g! So we have nominal weight. Then I built in thresholds. The thresholds would be used to guess if ‚Äúone biscuit has been removed‚Äù, ‚Äúa few biscuits have been removed‚Äù or ‚Äúgood god, someone‚Äòs cleaned you out!‚Äù. So with 3 thresholds and a simple 10% tolerance, we‚Äôre good to go‚Ä¶.and it worked!</p>
  <p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3940\" src=\"https://www.fl1digital.com/stuff/uploads/Biscuit-tin-3.jpg\" alt=\"Biscuit tin\" width=\"435\" height=\"931\" srcset=\"https://fl1digital.com/stuff/uploads/Biscuit-tin-3.jpg 435w, https://fl1digital.com/stuff/uploads/Biscuit-tin-3-140x300.jpg 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px\" /></p>
  <p><strong>So what next?</strong></p>
  <p>Well, I guess you need to tell someone right?</p>
  <p>I did what any web developer would do and built a simple <a href=\"https://fl1digital.com/what-is-an-api/\">API</a> using PHP.</p>
  <p>Simply put, the Raspberry takes a reading, if it‚Äôs out of tolerance, it posts it to the API.</p>
  <p>The API decides based on the reading whether it‚Äôs a biscuit, a few biscuits or a massive biscuit raid, then sends a notification via email.</p>
  <p>Great, so now my inbox is full of my kids‚Äô biscuit tin raids‚Ä¶that‚Äôs not enough, we can‚Äôt stop there!</p>
  <p>Next, an App‚Ä¶.because, well, why not!</p>
  <p>Being from an old skool C# background, I figured why try out Xamarin? Xamarin is Microsoft‚Äôs last Mobile application framework for .NET.</p>
  <p>So after a few weeks, voila, now I can monitor every movement of my biscuit tin, every addition, removal and I get push notifications in real-time!</p>
  <p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3942\" src=\"https://www.fl1digital.com/stuff/uploads/Biscuit-tin.jpg\" alt=\"Biscuit tin\" width=\"601\" height=\"491\" srcset=\"https://fl1digital.com/stuff/uploads/Biscuit-tin.jpg 601w, https://fl1digital.com/stuff/uploads/Biscuit-tin-300x245.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" /></p>
  <p><strong>So‚Ä¶was it worth it?</strong></p>
  <p>YES! I learnt soooo much, and got to build my first mobile app too! Not only that, my biscuit is now full again, since that little wire has been hanging out of the back, my little biscuit lovers won‚Äôt go near it üòâ</p>

            "content:encoded": "<p><strong>What is an API?</strong></p>
  <p>You might have heard the term banded around and wondered what it is? It‚Äôs an Application Programming Interface, but what‚Äôs that actually in English? Let us explain‚Ä¶</p>
  <p>Ok, so here‚Äôs the executive summary:</p>
  <p>An Application Programming Interface (API) is a way for two pieces of software to talk to each other behind the scenes.</p>
  <p>There you go, that wasn‚Äôt that complicated was it, and unless you want to get a little more under the hood, you‚Äôre welcome to leave at this point üòâ</p>
  <p><strong>Ok, where are APIs used in the real world?</strong></p>
  <p>First off APIs have been around since before the internet, even before MS-DOS days. Applications such as Microsoft Word, Excel, Sage Accounting have all have an API allowing software to share data with their software. This has allowed your spreadsheet to pull in data from a 3 rd piece of software or add-ons for Sage Accounting to use Sage data to add on further functionality not provided by the Sage product.</p>
  <p>Today, with the web, the concept is the same, the difference is you‚Äôre reading and writing data across the web rather than on a local PC.</p>
  <p>So that‚Äôs the history lesson out of the way, some uses‚Ä¶</p>
  <p>Let‚Äôs imagine you have an online shop and needed to push you order data in to your Xero accounting software. This is where your online shop would connect to Xero behind the scenes using the XERO API, login (Authenticate), then post the data through to your accounts).</p>
  <p>Let‚Äôs image your shop was linked to MailChimp to add people to your mailing list. Yup, you guessed it, that uses an API too, this time the MailChimp API.</p>
  <p>Want to embed Webinars from Zoom or GoToWebinar, you‚Äôll be using an API.<br />
  How about pushing enquiries from your site in to your Sales CRM software? You guessed it, an API.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Pushing enquiries from your site to a CRM</li>
  <li>Pull customer records from an ordering system to be available on your website</li>
  <li>Downloading licensed fonts</li>
  <li>Using Mapping services like Google Maps</li>
  <li>Using Post code lookups on your shop</li>
  <li>Getting shipping costs for your order</li>
  <li>Getting the latest exchange rates in realtime</li>
  <li>Looking up the market value of a property</li>
  <li>Getting a car insurance quote from an insurance provider</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All these things rely on APIs.</p>
  <p>So, this can cut two ways of course, you don‚Äôt have to pulling in data from another source, what about if you wanted your data or service to be available online?</p>
  <p>This is where having your own API can be useful allowing suppliers, customers or generally interested parties to access products, pricing, articles or just about anything!</p>
  <p>Anything you should know?</p>
  <p>One of the most common uses these days for APIs is with Mobile apps to retrieve data from a website. If you ever wondered how you can make a purchase on an app, log in to a website and by magic it knows about your purchase? Well now you know!</p>
  <p>If this has sparked your interest, or you think linking utilising data this way could help your business, drop us a line, and we‚Äôll pick up your query‚Ä¶.via an API of course üòâ</p>

            "content:encoded": "<p>On the 23rd June 2016, Britain voted to leave the European Union (EU).</p>
  <p>Whether you agree with the decision or not, change is inevitable, albeit it‚Äôs unclear how things will change.</p>
  <p>Whilst how and when the UK leaves is still undecided, what is certain is that it will impact both your business and your website.</p>
  <p><strong>Devaluation of the Pound</strong></p>
  <p>A devalued pound can potentially make goods and services more competitively priced outside of the UK, especially with digital or content-based goods that don‚Äôt require shipping fees, such as e-learning content and software.</p>
  <p>Conversely, if e-commerce sites ship products from Europe to customer/manufacturer, this can have an adverse effect, resulting in increased purchase and shipping costs. In turn, this could potentially mean pricing on UK sites being less competitive.<strong> </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Distance Selling Regulations/Consumer Contracts Regulations</strong></p>
  <p>On the 13th June 2014 Consumer Contracts Regulations replaced the previous Distance Selling Regulations under directive <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011L0083&amp;rid=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DIRECTIVE 2011/83/EU</a>.</p>
  <p>The legislation affected all 28 member states and aimed to update and improve on the previous Distance Selling Regulations in respect of contracts negotiated away from business premises.</p>
  <p>Some of the updates included:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Better refund rights</li>
  <li>Banning pre-ticked boxes on websites</li>
  <li>Eliminating hidden charges and costs on the internet</li>
  <li>Clearer information on who pays for returning goods</li>
  <li>Eliminating surcharges for the use of credit cards and hotlines</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Whilst it‚Äôs unclear whether this will change for UK businesses, it‚Äôs not inconceivable that the UK could derive their own adapted version of the current EU regulations that are currently in place.</p>
  <p><strong>Shipping</strong></p>
  <p>It‚Äôs likely that when we leave, UK businesses will see a large hike in the amount that is charged for shipping. In turn, this could result in a decrease of trade from consumers in the European Union, who were used to minimal shipping prices in the first instance.</p>
  <p>Similarly, if e-commerce sites ship products from Europe to customer/manufacturer and then sell on, import prices of materials and products could increase. This, in turn, could reduce the number of sales we see on e-commerce websites.</p>
  <p><strong>GDPR</strong></p>
  <p>Unless you‚Äôve been living on a remote island for the last year, at the very least you‚Äôd have heard of GDPR, which came into effect on the 25th May 2018. If you‚Äôre not familiar with the General Data Protection Act <a href=\"https://fl1digital.com/make-website-gdpr-compliant-data-general-protection-act/\">This will bring you up to speed</a></p>
  <p>Whilst the introduction of GDPR undoubtedly impacted businesses, and will continue to do so for some time, it‚Äôs entirely possible that the UK may, in time, adopt different legislation in this area, meaning it could be all change again!</p>
  <p><strong>Digital Single Market</strong></p>
  <p>The Digital Single Market is a strategy of the European Commission to ensure access to online activities for individuals and businesses under conditions of fair competition, consumer and data protection, removing geo-blocking and copyright issues.</p>
  <p>It‚Äôs not clear to see how and when this might impact UK websites at this stage, however it‚Äôs possible there could be mid to long-term changes as a result of Brexit.</p>
  <p>Some of the objectives of the Digital Single Market are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>New rules to stop unjustified geo-blocking, which will be effective from the 3rd December 2018</li>
  <li>Revised consumer protection rules that will enter into force in 2020</li>
  <li>New VAT rules for online sales of goods and services that will enter into force in 2021</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>.eu domain names</strong></p>
  <p>Once, buying a .eu domain was a typical choice for website owners looking to adopt a broader European market, and with them being simple to register from within the UK it‚Äôs easy to see why.</p>
  <p>Already, we‚Äôre starting to see notices like this from well known UK hosting companies, in this case Heart Internet.</p>
  <p>If you use a .eu domain name, get in touch, we can help.</p>

            "content:encoded": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are a business with a website that isn‚Äôt stuck in the early 2000‚Äôs (believe me they do still exist), you will most likely have the Google Maps feature embedded somewhere within your website that enables your users and customers to pinpoint exactly where your located. Simple, easy, free, right!? Unfortunately, not for much longer&#8230;</span></p>
  <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the 16th of July, using this feature on your website will incur a charge as part of changes towards more fair usage. That charge will be based on the number of uses of the API (Application Program Interface) and what type of map or API is used. Google will be combining the current 18 individual Maps APIs into three core products: Maps, Routes and Places. </span></p>
  <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means that charges will vary for a wide range of different industries. For example, if you just have the one map on your website to show users where you are, you could have an unlimited number of views monthly compared to a business directory or travel website who will be looking at higher charges. (Note: dynamic maps will allow unlimited free use unless you use features such as Directions or Search Mode). The same applies for Ecommerce websites that will use Maps and Routes features to calculate delivery costs. </span></p>
  <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a monthly credit of $200, most small businesses will probably find themselves not having to pay anything, it will simply depend on the nature of your business and how much your maps really get used. If you‚Äôd like to look into the new prices in more detail, view </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google‚Äôs official pricing &amp; plans here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>
  <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To break it down, $200 a month will get you:</span></p>
  <ul>
  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">up to 28,000 free loads of Dynamic Maps; or</span></li>
  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">up to 100,000 free loads of Static Maps; or</span></li>
  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">up to 40,000 free Directions calls; or</span></li>
  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">up to 40,000 free Geolocation calls.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <h3><b>What happens if I don‚Äôt upgrade or sign up before the 11th of June? </b></h3>
  <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To put it plain and simple, you won‚Äôt be able to use the feature, you‚Äôll receive a lovely error or watermark displayed instead which could be pretty damaging to user experience on your website. </span></p>
  <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To keep your Maps API running from the 16th of July, you‚Äôll need to upgrade to the latest version which involves creating a Google account and registering with your credit card. This will enable you to have a new API key which will allow you, or your web designer to carry out the upgrade.</span></p>
